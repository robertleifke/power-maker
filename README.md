# ðŸ¤– Numo2

![Group 224](https://github.com/numotrade/numo/assets/44106773/6e2e3ef8-708c-4e4b-90e6-0d332c9cdea0)

The repository contains the smart contract suite for Numo2 -- the solidity implementation of a [*replicating market maker*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14769) on the EVM. One that replicates an options strategy that quadruples your returns at every price. Unique to Numo2 is that it can support any token. It can do this because it requires no oracles or sophisticated market makers. The result is a simple way of accessing leverage on any token.

### How are my returns quadruple? 

Numo2 runs a continous automated options strategy that quadruples your returns at every price up until you hit your strike price. The strategy is implemented as a **trading function** of the automated market maker so that the pools of tokens always rebalance to reflect a *leveraged position*. 

## Local development

This project uses [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) as the development framework.

### Dependencies

```bash
forge install
```

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

```bash
npm install create3-factory
```

### Compilation

```bash
forge build
```

### Test

```bash
forge test
```

### Local setup

In order to test third party integrations such as interfaces, it is possible to set up a forked mainnet with several positions open

```bash
sh anvil.sh
```

then, in a separate terminal,

```bash
sh setup.sh
```
